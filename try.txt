Threading is an essential concept in operating systems, particularly in managing multiple user requests efficiently. Without threading, a server can only handle one request at a time, leading to significant delays. By utilizing multiple threads, a server can allocate a new thread to each incoming request, ensuring simultaneous processing. However, constantly creating and deleting threads for each request can be inefficient. This is where thread pools come into play. A thread pool creates a predefined number of threads at server startup, reducing the overhead of frequent thread creation and deletion. Incoming requests are assigned to available threads, and once a task is completed, the thread is returned to the pool for reuse. This method significantly optimizes resource usage and improves server performance.
