Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed for processing sequential data, where the output at each time step depends not only on the current input but also on previous computations. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs maintain a hidden state that carries information from past inputs, allowing them to model temporal dependencies. This makes them particularly effective for tasks such as speech recognition, language modeling, and time series prediction. However, standard RNNs suffer from issues like vanishing and exploding gradients, which can hinder learning over long sequences, leading to the development of more advanced architectures like LSTMs and GRUs.
