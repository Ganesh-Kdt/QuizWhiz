The UB AI for Good Design Challenge is a three-day hackathon scheduled for February 21-23, 2025, at the University at Buffalo. Organized by the UB Startup and Innovation Collaboratory in partnership with various UB departments and TechBuffalo, the event challenges participants to develop AI-driven solutions to major societal issues. The hackathon features team formation, work sessions, tech talks, and judging, with prizes including drones, Nest Hubs, portable speakers, and e-picture frames1. Participants are required to submit a proposed solution, visual representations, and a presentation detailing their project. The event aims to foster innovation, creative problem-solving, and business plan development while providing valuable insights into AI and technology solutions. This hackathon builds upon the success of previous AI-focused events at UB, such as the inaugural AI Hackathon Challenge held in September 2024, which similarly aimed to leverage AI to address real-world challenges for local businesses and community organizations
